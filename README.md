## AWS-Terraform basic + S3
## David Eliason 12/14/2024

This project builds off my previous repo. 

I updated the Data Source for the AMI to point to Amazon Linux 2 AMI, referencing the latest AMI available. This keeps hard-coding from being implemented.
I upded the public key from hard coded to reference the local file for best practices.
